<h1>Project Title: Real-Time Bus Tracker</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
An interactive website that tracks MBTA bus movements and seat availability on a real-time basis. It leverages Mapbox and MBTA API to showcase a livemap and indicate buses taking the <b>Harvard Square - Nubian Station</b> route and colour codes the buses to give users an idea of live seat occupancy.

<h2>How to Run</h2>
Repository includes html, javascript and image files. Download them and ensure it's in the same file structure.
<ul>
  <li>You will need to create an account to get an access token for <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a></li>
  <li>You will need do an API call for MBTA live data.</li>
</ul>
<br>View the demo website <a href="https://jadewee.github.io/projects/maps.html">here.

<h3>Roadmap of future improvements</h3>
  This is my plan to work on next in this repository:
  <ul>
    <li>Add more routes with selection options for users to toggle and view the different routes in the area</li>
    <li>Change the map from dark to light based on time of day</li>
    <li>Change the bus icon to make it more intuitive and update with small bus stop icons</li>
  </ul>
